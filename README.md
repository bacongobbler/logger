Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage
applications on your own servers. Deis builds on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to provide
a lightweight, [Heroku-inspired](http://heroku.com) workflow.

![Deis Graphic](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/get-deis/deis-graphic-small.png)

A system logger for use in the [Deis](http://deis.io) open source PaaS.

This Docker image is based on the official
[alpine:3.2](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) image.

## Description
The new v2 logger implementation has seen a simplification from the last rewrite. While it still uses much of that code it no longer depends on `etcd`. Instead, we will use kubernetes service discovery to determine where logger is running.

We have also decided to not use `logspout` as the mechanism to get logs from each container to the `logger` component. Now we will use [fluentd](http://fluentd.org) which is a widely supported logging framework with hundreds of plugins. This will allow the end user to configure multiple destinations such as Elastic Search and other Syslog compatible endpoints like [papertrail](http://papertrailapp.com).

** This image requires that the `Daemon Sets` api be available on the kubernetes cluster** For more information on running the `Daemon Sets` api see the [following](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/api.md#enabling-resources-in-the-extensions-group).

## Running logger v2
The following environment variables can be used to configure logger:

* `STORAGE_ADAPTER`: How to store logs that are sent to the logger interface. Default is `memory`
* `NUMBER_OF_LINES`: How many lines to store in the ring buffer. Default is `1000`.

### Installation
Because of the requirement of Daemon Sets we have chosen not to include the logging components in the main [Deis chart](https://github.com/deis/charts/tree/master/deis).

To install the logging system please do the following:

```
$ helm repo add deis https://github.com/deis/charts
$ helm install deis/deis-logger
```
Watch for the logging components to come up:

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=deis
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
deis-builder-knypb          1/1       Running   0          1d
deis-database-ldbam         1/1       Running   0          2h
deis-logger-fluentd-tq187   1/1       Running   0          1d
deis-logger-iwos5           1/1       Running   0          2d
deis-minio-zlmk8            1/1       Running   0          3d
deis-registry-bys9n         1/1       Running   0          3d
deis-router-h5f0i           1/1       Running   0          3d
deis-workflow-2v84b         1/1       Running   3          2d
```

After the logging components are installed you will need to restart the `deis-workflow` pod so it can pick up the new service endpoint for the logger component.

```
$ kubectl delete pod <workflow pod name>
```

The replication controller should immediately restart a new pod. Now you can use the `deis logs` command for your applications.

## Development
The only assumption this project makes about your environment is that you have a working docker host to build the image against.

### Building binary and image
To build the binary and image run the following make command:

```console
DEV_REGISTRY=quay.io IMAGE_PREFIX=myaccount make build
IMAGE_PREFIX=myaccount make build
DEV_REGISTRY=myhost:5000 make build
```

### Pushing the image
The makefile assumes that you are pushing the image to a remote repository like quay or dockerhub. So you will need to supply the `REGISTRY` environment variable.

```console
DEV_REGISTRY=quay.io IMAGE_PREFIX=myaccount make push
IMAGE_PREFIX=myaccount make push
DEV_REGISTRY=myhost:5000 make push
```

### Kubernetes interactions
* `DEV_REGISTRY=quay.io IMAGE_PREFIX=myaccount make kube-create`: Does a sed replacement of the image name and creates a tmp manifest file that we will use to deploy logger component to kubernetes. This will also start 2 `fluentd` daemonsets.
* `make kube-delete`: This will remove all the logger components from the kubernetes cluster.
* `DEV_REGISTRY=quay.io IMAGE_PREFIX=myaccount make kube-replace`: This will rebuild the binary and image, push it to the remote registry, and then replace the running components with the new version.
