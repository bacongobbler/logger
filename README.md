# Deis Logger
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deis/logger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deis/logger) [![Go Report Card](http://goreportcard.com/badge/deis/logger)](http://goreportcard.com/report/deis/logger)


A system logger for use in the [Deis](http://deis.io) open source PaaS.

This Docker image is based on the official
[alpine:3.2](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) image.

## Description
The new v2 logger implementation has seen a simplification from the last rewrite. While it still uses much of that code it no longer depends on `etcd`. Instead, we will use kubernetes service discovery to determine where logger is running.

We have also decided to not use `logspout` as the mechanism to get logs from each container to the `logger` component. Now we will use [fluentd](http://fluentd.org) which is a widely supported logging framework with hundreds of plugins. This will allow the end user to configure multiple destinations such as Elastic Search and other Syslog compatible endpoints like [papertrail](http://papertrailapp.com).

** This image requires that the `daemonsets` api be available on the kubernetes cluster** For more information on running the `daemonsets` api see the [following](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/api.md#enabling-resources-in-the-extensions-group).

## Running logger v2
The following environment variables can be used to configure logger:

* `LOGGER_ADDR`: The interface to bind the logging adapter to. Default is `0.0.0.0`.
* `LOGGER_PORT`: The port that the logger adapter is listening on. Default is `514`.
* `WEB_ADDR`: The interface to bind the web server to. Default is `0.0.0.0`.
* `WEB_PORT`: The port that the web server is listening on. Default is `8088`.
* `STORAGE_ADAPTER`: How to store logs that are sent to the logger interface. Default is `memory`
* `NUMBER_OF_LINES`: How many lines to store in the ring buffer. Default is `1000`.
* `LOG_PATH`: The path of where to store files when using the file storage adapter. Default is `/data/logs`.
* `DRAIN_URL`: Syslog server that the logger component can send data to. No default.

## Development
The only assumption this project makes about your environment is that you have a working docker host to build the image against.

### Building binary and image
To build the binary and image run the following make command:

```console
REGISTRY=quay.io/myaccount make build
REGISTRY=myaccount make build
REGISTRY=myhost:5000 make build
```

### Pushing the image
The makefile assumes that you are pushing the image to a remote repository like quay or dockerhub. So you will need to supply the `REGISTRY` environment variable.

```console
REGISTRY=quay.io/myaccount make push
REGISTRY=myaccount make push
REGISTRY=myhost:5000 make push
```

### Kubernetes interactions
* `REGISTRY=quay.io/myaccount make kube-create`: Does a sed replacement of the image name and creates a tmp manifest file that we will use to deploy logger component to kubernetes. This will also start 2 `fluentd` daemonsets.
* `make kube-delete`: This will remove all the logger components from the kubernetes cluster.
* `REGISTRY=quay.io/myaccount make kube-replace`: This will rebuild the binary and image, push it to the remote registry, and then replace the running components with the new version.
